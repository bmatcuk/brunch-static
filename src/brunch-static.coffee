  # We say we are a "template" plugin because javascript plugins will
  # append to the javascript file. This is a problem because,
  # if wrapping is enabled (like commonjs), this will cause a bunch of
  # empty crap to be written to the javascript file. Stylesheets, on the
  # other hand, don't have any wrapping but will trigger compilation watchers
  # as if the CSS has been changed. Instead, templates that return an empty string
  # to brunch after compiling, this will just result in an unwrapped but empty
  # line to the JS, which will be removed by minifying anyway. It's a hack =(
